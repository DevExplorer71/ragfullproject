i want to create an app where individuals can upload documents under a topic.

the app could use something like rag to take the documents split them up and store them in firestore

i could use open ai for the llm

the user could ask questions in the app and would recieve ai based answers

is firestore a good backend for this app?

also want to user firebase auth for authentication.
